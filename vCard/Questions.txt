Questions to managers of vCard on devoy.

/// Implementation-Related ///
See also the "Unclearness" section in README.md.
* Some WD IDs in Qualifiers.lua were merged, so I guess we should upd the module.

/// Personal ///
* Why is the name "vCard"? I heard that vCard is a format of (digital) business card, and on the other hand hCard is a format to markup to HTML.
* There are many modules for the access to Wikidata in javoy, so can we integrate those?
